number zero in binary 00000000
number five in binary 00000101

decimal value = [bit value at position 0]*2^0 + [bit value at position 1]*2^1 ... + [bit value at position n]*2^n

calculating the number 5 above
[1]*2^(0) + [0]*2^(1) + [1]*2^(2) + [0]*2^(3) + [0]*2^(4) + [0]*2^(5) + [0]*2^(6) + [0]*2^(7) = 5
